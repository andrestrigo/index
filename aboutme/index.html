    <h2> Andrés </h2>
    <p> Hello everybody, since this website is about me, I will write about the MUST know information about me. I am from Chile, South America. My wife and I are currently living in a small city located in the Atacama Desert (the most arid desert in the world) and it is near one of the biggest open pit copper mines that exist.  </p>
    <p> At a very young age I begin to play competitive badminton and I had the opportunity to travel to different places representing my city and country. On December of 2006 I received the award of best badminton player of the year. A couple of months after that I had the privilege to serve as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Argentina Rosario from February 2007 to February 2009. </p>
    <p> After returning from my missionary service, I went to United States to study. After a few years of learning I completed my bachelor’s degree at BYU-Idaho and returned to Chile where I met my beautiful wife. Nowadays, I do my best to help the young man in my ward to reach their potential and I also teach English Connect 2 to members of my ward and stake. </p>
